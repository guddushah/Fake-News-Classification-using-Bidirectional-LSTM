# Fake News Classification using Bidirectional LSTM

### Bidirectional LSTM
Bidirectional LSTM or BiLSTM is a term used for a sequence model which contains two LSTM layers, one for processing input in the forward direction and the other for processing in the backward direction. It is usually used in NLP-related tasks. The intuition behind this approach is that by processing data in both directions, the model is able to better understand the relationship between sequences (e.g. knowing the following and preceding words in a sentence).
